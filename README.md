QCL-Lab1
========

This file implements superdense coding and teleportation in QCL, with tests. 

Superdense coding allows an individual to encode two bits of information in a single qubit, provided that it is part of an EPR (bell) pair. 

Teleportation allows the state of a qubit to be transferred to another, by using a classical channel and an intermediary qubit. 

Tips: If you are having trouble buidling QCL on the latest GCC, add the flag -fpermissive to the QCL makefile.
